SMT soldering workshop
======================
In November 2014, Buckeye Current started to run a surface-mount soldering workshop in partnership with the ECE department. This repo has the course materials and some notes for people who are teaching the class.

Most of the notes are stored on the [Buckeye Current wiki page](http://wiki.buckeyecurrent.com/w/Soldering_workshop).
